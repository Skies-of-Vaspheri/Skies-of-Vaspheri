## Hello Travler! 👋

I'm Sky Stonehocker.

Presently, I'm a Computer Science student and software engineer largely still developing my skills in the field. However, here you can find a handful of the more interesting things I have worked on in my time, ranging from academic work to my own fun projects. 

### Skills
As is, the majority of my proficiency lies in C++.

Though, outside the technical world, I also have skills in academic and creative writing, research, using DAWs like Cubase, and using Google Workspace.

### Miscellany
Outside of CS, I also have a longstanding interest astronomy and worldbuilding!

### Elsewhere
You can find me on LinkedIn [HERE](https://www.linkedin.com/in/scott-stonehocker-7a3a29386/)
